# Machine-Learning-HMM-Data-Driven-Modeling-Prediction
This Project implements Hidden Markov Model to development data-driven model for solar radiation prediction.
Various methods are used here to learn the model including:
Gibbs Sampling, EM Algorithm and the MLE methods.
The prediction is finished by Viterbi Algorithm, which generate the optimal hidden states sequence based on time-series data.
